<p>Dream interpretation is a tool to understand mental processes of which we are not directly aware. Dreams often appear enigmatic, confusing or meaningless, but through interpretation they can reveal our mostly deeply held beliefs, fantasies and desires. In our one-on-one sessions you will freely associate to the elements of your dream, saying whatever comes to mind without censorship. I will listen attentively and without judgement, helping you unravel the patterns of your unconscious thought. For many the practice is a powerful method to overcome creative blocks and find a deeper self-understanding.</p>    </section>
